## 📖 About

**Meow Meow World** is a unique adventure where players control cute kitten characters, each with their own personality and story. 

Inspired by titles such as *Geometry Dash*, *Mario*, *Terraria*, and *Genshin Impact*, it combines elements from each to bring a unique world to life. The game challenges your thinking—some scenarios require logical solutions, such as choosing the right weapon, solving puzzles, or finding ways to get past barriers.

> "We developed Meow Meow World because many modern games require large storage, a stable internet connection, and often expose players to toxic environments. We wanted something different—an offline game that works on PC while still being fun, challenging, and unique."

## ✨ Features

- **🐾 Cute Characters**: Play as distinct kitten characters, each with their own story, personality, and legacy.
- **⚔️ 3-Wave System**: Every level features a challenging 3-wave system where players must defeat enemies and survive.
- **🧠 Strategy & Logic**: Choose the right weapons and tools to overcome obstacles and "boss" scenarios.
- **🌍 Multiple Worlds**: Explore diverse locations like *Purrlantic Shores* and *Whiskerwood Hollow* (more coming soon!).
- **👥 Two-Player Mode**: Optional mode to share the fun with a friend.
