## About
Meow Meow World was created because many modern games require large storage, a stable internet connection, and often expose players to toxic environments. We wanted something different—an offline game that works on PC (and possibly mobile in the future) while still being fun, challenging, and unique.

This game is inspired by titles such as Geometry Dash, Mario, Terraria, and Genshin Impact, taking elements from each to bring our own world to life.

Meow Meow World features gameplay that stands out from typical platformers. Each run includes three waves that begin after the story sequence. Your goal is to clear every wave using different weapons and tools. The game is designed to challenge your thinking—some scenarios require logical solutions, such as choosing the right weapon, solving puzzles, or finding ways to get past barriers.

You play as cute kitten characters, each with their own story, personality, and legacy, making the adventure more fun and engaging.

Players can select from different worlds, enjoy two-player mode, and experience multiple levels and characters, each with their own unique storylines.
